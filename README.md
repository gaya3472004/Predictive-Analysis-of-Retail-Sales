# Predictive-Analysis-of-Retail-Sales

This project focuses on predicting retail sales using predictive analytics techniques. The goal is to forecast future sales based on historical data, enabling retailers to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, staffing, and overall business strategy.


## Introduction

In the retail industry, accurately predicting sales is crucial for optimizing various aspects of business operations. This project aims to develop machine learning models that can forecast retail sales based on historical sales data, promotional events, and other relevant factors.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the Global Superstore dataset, which contains historical sales data from XYZ Retail Company. It includes information such as sales volume, product categories, dates, and external factors etc.

## Methods

Several machine learning algorithms were explored for predicting retail sales, including:

- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. Cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate model performance and select the best-performing algorithm.

## Results

The predictive models achieved promising results with an average accuracy of 78%. Visualizations such as time series plots and feature importance charts provide insights into sales patterns and factors influencing sales performance.
